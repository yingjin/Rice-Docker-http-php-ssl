<p>We have experienced problems recently with downloads of PDF files by folks using the most recent version of the FireFox browser on the Windows platform. We believe this is a FireFox bug and have reported it to them. You can download the file directly to your PC by right-clicking on the image thumbnail or the "View/Open" link, then select the "Save link as..." (or it may say "Save target as...") and then saving it wherever you want on your PC.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:rudr@rice.edu">let us know</a> if you have any additional difficulties.</p>
